      <p> Based on an Indian board game of chance, snakes and ladders is a game for children to understand that life can be a game of chance. The ladders represent good luck and the snakes misfortune.
        Each player chooses a colored token and clicks the button to roll the dice. Tokens move from the bottom of the board to the top representing the start and end of a phase in life.
        If a token lands at the bottom of a ladder, good fortune speeds them to the top of the ladder. However, if it lands on a snake,
        usually very close to a ladder, misfortune sends them back down the board. Just as in the game of life there are winners and losers, so too, the person who reaches the end of the board first wins the game. <h4>Start Playing</h4></p>
